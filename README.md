# Python-Challenge


Overview: One of the datasets included in this repository is election data. It includes Ballot id, county, and canidate. For the second dataset, it contains date and profit/losses of the company for that month.


For the election dataset. I created a python script that returns the total votes casted. A list of canidates with thier total votes casted for them and the percentage of of votes for them. It also has the canidate winner. For the budget data set, I created a python script that detials the total months that the data was collected from. The net profit of the company, the average loss of money over the entire dataset. It also details the highest increases in profits and greatest decrease. Resources I used to help me write code are INstructor Drew's speed runs and recorded class sessions. I also used Official Python Docs as a reference to write the code. Inside the folder PyBank/resources, contains my PyBank.ipynb. Inside my PyPoll folder, it contains PyPoll.ipynb. Both were my original .ipynb. The output folder located in my main branch contains PyPoll.py and PyBank.py. Inside is also my exported text file of the output for my py scripts. They are named election_results.txt and financial_analysis.txt.
